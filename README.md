# Welcome to My First Ever Blockchain!

Hi! Well this is just another project that I have built while learning Blockchain. The motive behind building this Blockchain is to learn the basic concepts behind this technology. I have covered the following **aspects** that are essentially required for a Blockchain to be considered as valid:

 - Immutable
 - Proof of work
 - Distributed
 - Consensus

Because of the above mentioned aspects the Blockchain will have the following **capabilities** :

 - Enabled Trust
 - Multi-party contribution
 - Transparency
 - Searching Transactions, Blocks and Address' Data based upon their Transaction-Id, Block-Hash and Addresses respectively
